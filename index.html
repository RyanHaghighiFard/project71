  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">At the building teens have access to many different activities and opportunities to explore interests. On site we have 2 pool tables, a ping pong table, tons of board games, a half basketball court, a gaga ball pit, a sewing machine, musical instruments (guitars, bass, keyboard, electronic drum kit, midi controller, etc), computer and sound recording equipment, paints and art supplies. We have a free table with food, clothing, and school supplies for teens who may be in need of any of these necessities. We offer dinner 2 nights a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays and teens have access to a 5:00pm late bus on these days to expand potential access for those interested in attending. We offer volunteer opportunities for teens looking to make an impact in their community, partnering with a variety of local organizations (such as the historical society and Gigi’s Playhouse). We host events and tournaments regularly such as open mic nights,Friday night fires, pool tournaments, and cooking classes. Over summers and occasionally throughout the school year we take teens on field trips into the community and offer overnight trips such as our yearly summer whale watch trip to Salem, Massachusetts. We hold Teen Council meetings, typically on a monthly basis, where teens get the opportunity to discuss and voice opinions on activity and event planning, things they’d like to see happen, changes needed, or any other types of ideas they may have. All teens who participate in the program are welcome to attend the Teen Council meetings. </p>
